            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p class="muted">Born from a passion for holistic wellness</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Founded in 2020, <strong>YogaMart</strong> began as a small community of dedicated practitioners seeking to create a sanctuary for mind-body wellness. What started as intimate group sessions in a local park has evolved into a comprehensive yoga studio offering diverse classes, workshops, and wellness courses.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our founder, Sarah Chen, discovered yoga during a challenging period in her life. The practice not only helped her find physical strength and flexibility but also provided mental clarity and emotional balance. Inspired by this transformation, she set out to create a space where others could experience the same profound benefits.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, YogaMart serves hundreds of students weekly, from complete beginners taking their first downward dog to advanced practitioners deepening their meditation practice. We believe that yoga is for every body, every mind, and every spirit.
